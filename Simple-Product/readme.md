# Simple Detail Product Card

## Overview  
This is my implementation of a **Product Card** UI component from a devchallenges.io. 
The goal was to build a clean, responsive card using HTML and CSS, and deploy it live so I can show my end-to-end workflow.

## What I Learned  
- Semantic HTML structure to represent the card component (image, title, description, price, call-to-action).  
- CSS styling for layout, spacing, image handling, typography and responsive design.  
- Responsive breakpoints to ensure the card looks good on mobile, tablet and desktop.  
- Image aspect ratio control and container styling so the card remains visually balanced.  
- Deployment via GitHub → Netlify: commit, push, live URL available.  
## Tech Stack  
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Deployed via Netlify

## Future Improvements
