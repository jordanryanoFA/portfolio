# Blog Card — devChallenges.io
This is my solution for the Blog Card challenge from devChallenges.io.
The goal of this project was to practice building a clean, responsive card component using HTML and CSS, focusing on layout, typography, and consistent spacing. 

# What I Learned

- While building this project, I learned and practiced:

- How to structure semantic HTML for reusable UI components.

- Using Flexbox for alignment and layout.

- Controlling responsive design with relative units (em, rem, %) and media queries.

- Applying consistent spacing using CSS variables or utility classes.

- Managing typography hierarchy (titles, body text, author section).

- Working with images and aspect ratios to make layouts look clean on all devices.

- Building a minimal yet elegant card design from scratch — no frameworks!
