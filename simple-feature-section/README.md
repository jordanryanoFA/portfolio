ðŸ“¸ Overview

This challenge helped me practice responsive layout design, semantic structure, and modern CSS styling.
I focused on creating a clean design that adapts smoothly across screen sizes.

ðŸ§  What I Learned

<!-- Using semantic HTML -->
<main class="features">
  <h1>Our Features</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">We make building fast and easy for everyone.</p>
</main>

/* Creating circular icon backgrounds with emojis */
.icon {
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  background-color: #facc15;
  color: #0f172a;
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
