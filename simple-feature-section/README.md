# Simple Feature Section  
Solution to the “Simple Feature Section” challenge from devChallenges.io

## Overview  
This project is my take on the feature section challenge from [devChallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io).  
The goal: build a clean, responsive feature section using HTML & CSS only, with semantic markup and layout techniques.

🔗 **Live Demo:** [https://simple-feature-section-app.netlify.app/](https://simple-feature-section-app.netlify.app/)

## What I Learned  
- Semantic HTML structure for sections, headings, and feature cards.

- CSS Grid for creating a flexible, responsive grid layout (grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(320px, 1fr))).

- Flexbox for arranging card content vertically (display: flex; flex-direction: column).

- Hover effects with smooth transitions (transform: translateY + box-shadow) to enhance interactivity.

- Responsive typography and spacing using rem and relative units.

- Color and theme management: dark background (#0f172a) with accent colors for icons (yellow, pink, purple).

- Custom emoji icons inside circles (.icon) for visual emphasis.

- Image handling with object-fit: cover to maintain aspect ratio and card layout.

- Deployment workflow using Netlify for live previews.

## Built With  
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Flexbox / Grid, media queries)  
- Google Fonts: Inter

## Responsive Design  
- Mobile: cards stacked vertically (single column)

- Tablet/Desktop: responsive grid with auto-fitting columns

- Ensures visual balance and readability across all screen sizes
