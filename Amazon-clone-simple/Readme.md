# Simple Amazon Clone

A basic clone of Amazon's homepage built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates fundamental web development skills including responsive design, dynamic product display, and search functionality. It's intended as a portfolio piece to showcase front-end development abilities.

## Features

- **Product Display**: Showcases a list of featured products with images, names, and prices.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for products by name in real-time.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes, including mobile devices.
- **Clean UI**: Mimics Amazon's color scheme and layout for a familiar user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: Styling, including Flexbox for layout and media queries for responsiveness.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Dynamic product rendering and search logic.
- **Google Fonts**: Roboto font for typography.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.

- **Add to Cart Feature**: Implement a shopping cart functionality with local storage or backend persistence, including cart management (add, remove, update quantities).
- **User Accounts**: Add user registration and login to enable personalized experiences, order history, and wishlists.
- **Payment Integration**: Integrate payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal for secure checkout.
- **Advanced Search and Filters**: Enhance search with filters by category, price range, and sorting options.
- **Responsive Enhancements**: Further optimize for various devices and screen sizes, including tablet views.
- **API Endpoints**: Create RESTful APIs for product management and user interactions.
- **Database**: Use a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to store product and user data dynamically.
