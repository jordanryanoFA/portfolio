# My Web Development Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository!
This repo contains different projects I’ve built while learning web development.
Each project has its own folder.

📂 Projects Included

   1. Nasa Clone App – Fetches and displays NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day using their public API.
   2. Tours App - Tours App – Fetches and displays a list of tours from an API. Users can view tour details (title, price, description), toggle “Read More” to expand/collapse text, remove tours with a “Not Interested” button, and refresh the list when empty. Alerts are shown using react-toastify for better user feedback.
   3. Lorem Generator - A simple and customizable Lorem Ipsum text generator built with React. Users can select the number of paragraphs to generate and instantly copy or use the output.
   4. FAQ (Frequent Ask Question) - a simple web app about Frequent Ask Questions
