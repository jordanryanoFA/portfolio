# Responsive Process Page
This project is my solution to the Process Page Challenge on devChallenges.io, designed to replicate a professional multi-column feature section.

The primary goal was to achieve pixel-perfect visual fidelity to the provided design mockup while ensuring the component is fully responsive across all device sizes, from desktop down to mobile.
I focused heavily on using modern CSS techniques to build a clean, maintainable, and highly accurate front-end component.

# Technologies Used
HTML5: Structured the content semantically, including integration of custom SVG icons.

CSS3: Used for all styling, layout, and visual refinements.

CSS Grid: Utilized for creating the core 3-column feature layout and managing responsiveness transitions.

Media Queries: Implemented a strategic mobile-first approach to transition the layout smoothly from 3 columns to 2 columns, and finally to a single-column stack.
