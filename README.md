# My Web Development Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository!
This repo contains different projects I’ve built while learning web development.
Each project has its own folder with source code and explanation.

📂 Projects Included

   1. Nasa Clone App – Fetches and displays NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day using their public API.
   2. Tours App - Tours App – Fetches and displays a list of tours from an API. Users can view tour details (title, price, description), toggle “Read More” to expand/collapse text, remove tours with a “Not Interested” button, and refresh the list when empty. Alerts are shown using react-toastify for better user feedback.

      (More projects will be added soon...)
