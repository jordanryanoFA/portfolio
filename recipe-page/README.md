# Recipe Page — Frontend Mentor Challenge

This is a solution to the **Recipe Page challenge on Frontend Mentor**. The goal of this project is to practice semantic HTML, responsive layout structure, and careful attention to typography and spacing based on a provided design.

Frontend Mentor challenges help improve coding skills by building real projects from realistic UI mockups.

## ✨ What I Learned

This project helped reinforce several core front-end development skills:

- How to structure content using **semantic HTML tags** such as `<main>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, and `<figure>`.
- How to use **CSS custom properties** to maintain consistent design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing).
- Implementing a **mobile-first responsive layout** and adjusting spacing and font sizes using media queries.
- How to style lists (`ul`, `ol`), tables, and layout spacing to match a design system.
- When to use `<div>` vs semantic elements, especially related to accessibility and document structure.
- Styling reusable UI patterns such as separators using utility classes instead of repeating markup like `<hr>`.
